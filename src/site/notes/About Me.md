Hey! I'm **JP** - a designer, programmer, and engineer who loves solving problems, no matter the size.

I’m all about learning new stuff, so I’m constantly diving into programming, data, engineering, science, history, and organizing.

When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me reading, learning, staying fit, or jamming out on my guitar.

You can learn more about me by visiting my [official website & portfolio](https://jp-panonce.github.io)
