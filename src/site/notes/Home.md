<h1>JP's eudaimonia</h1>

> [!quote] An unexamined life isn‚Äôt worth living


**Welcome to my Eudaimonia**.   *a place for my thoughts, insights, learnings and things I want to* share to everyone interested. 

<br>
There's lots to explore here, such as:

 üìñ **[[Book Notes & Reviews\|Book Notes & Reviews]]**
   I often share my insights on books I've read. When I do, I post it here :)

üí° **[[Knowledge Sharing\|Knowledge Sharing]]**
On topics from literature, math, sciences, technology, philosophy, history and more, I share knowledge in the best possible way I could. I believe, if everyone is knowledgeable, then we can be more empathetic and make this world a better place for everyone.

üòä **[[Experiences & Thoughts\|Experiences & Thoughts]]**
  some experiences I want to share for awareness, insights or just for letting it out

üèóÔ∏è **[[Projects\|Projects]]**
I share a very detailed account on how I developed my personal side-projects, which I create to practice my skills
