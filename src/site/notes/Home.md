# JP's eudaimonia

#### **welcome to my eudaimonia**
*a place for my thoughts, insights, learnings and things I want to* share to everyone interested. There's lots to explore here, such as:


 📖 **[[Book Notes & Reviews/All Book Notes & Reviews\|Book Notes & Reviews]]**
   I often share my insights on books I've read. When I do, I post it here :)

💡**[[Knowledge Sharing/All Knowledge Sharing\|Knowledge Sharing]]**
On topics from literature, math, sciences, technology, philosophy, history and more, I share knowledge in the best possible way I could. I believe, if everyone is knowledgeable, then we can be more empathetic and make this world a better place for everyone.

😊**[[Experiences/All Experiences\|Experiences]]**
  some experiences I want to share for awareness, insights or just for sharing


🏗️**[[Projects/All Projects\|Projects]]**
I share a very detailed account on how I developed my personal side-projects, which I create to practice my skills
