<h1>JP's eudaimonia</h1>

> [!quote] Socrates, Plato's Apology 
> An unexamined life isn’t worth living

**Welcome to my Eudaimonia**.   *a place for my thoughts, insights, learnings and things I want to* share to everyone interested. 

<br>
There's lots to explore here, such as:

 📖 **[[Book Notes & Reviews\|Book Notes & Reviews]]**
   I often share my insights on books I've read. When I do, I post it here :)

💡 **[[Knowledge Sharing\|Knowledge Sharing]]**
On topics from literature, math, sciences, technology, philosophy, history and more, I share knowledge in the best possible way I could. I believe, if everyone is knowledgeable, then we can be more empathetic and make this world a better place for everyone.

😊 **[[Experiences & Thoughts\|Experiences & Thoughts]]**
  some experiences I want to share for awareness, insights or just for letting it out


🏗️ **[[Projects\|Projects]]**
I share a very detailed account on how I developed my personal side-projects, which I create to practice my skills

#### ABOUT ME

Hey! I'm **JP** - a designer, programmer, and engineer who loves solving problems, no matter the size.

I’m all about learning new stuff, so I’m constantly diving into programming, data, engineering, science, history, and organizing.

When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me reading, learning, staying fit, or jamming out on my guitar.

You can learn more about me by visiting my [official website & portfolio](https://jp-panonce.github.io)
