## ðŸ¤µWho am I?

![me_2017.png](/img/user/Resources/me_2017.png)
Iâ€™mÂ **JP** -- a designer, programmer and engineer powered by people and problems big or small.  

My superpower isÂ _**[materialize]**_Â - materializing all your ideas, and turning them into something that makes your life easier.  
  
Fully committed to the philosophy of life-long learning, Iâ€™m a developer with a passion for programming, data and all things engineering & science, as well as history, organizing and more.  
  
When Iâ€™m not at my computer I like to spend my time reading, keeping fit and playing guitar.
