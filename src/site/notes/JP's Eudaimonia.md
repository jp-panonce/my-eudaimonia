## 🤵Who am I?

![me_2017.png](/img/user/Resources/me_2017.png)
I’m **JP** (my nickname anyways) - a designer, programmer and engineer powered by people and problems big or small.  
My superpower is _**[materialize]**_ - materializing all your ideas, and turning them into something that makes your life easier.  
  
Fully committed to the philosophy of life-long learning, I’m a developer with a passion for programming, data and all things engineering & science, as well as history, organizing and more.  
  
When I’m not at my computer I like to spend my time reading, keeping fit and playing guitar.
