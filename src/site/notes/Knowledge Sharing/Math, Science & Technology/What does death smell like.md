Well, DUUH!! IT SMELLS BAD. END OF DISCUSSION.

You're right, corpses do smell bad, but do you know what makes it smell bad? gotchaa

The smell of death might be  something you know it when you smell it. Once a person dies, the corpse doesn't smell bad right away. It only starts at a certain point -- decomposition. 

Decomposition happens in a couple of stages, each of which has a slightly different smell profile involving around 800 different chemicals.
