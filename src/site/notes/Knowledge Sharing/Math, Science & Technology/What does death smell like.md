## Introduction

From the title of the post itself, you may answer me "it smells bad, duuh". You're right, corpses do smell bad, but do you know what makes it smell bad? 

The smell of death is something you know it when you smell it. Once a person dies, the corpse doesn't smell bad right away. It only starts at a certain point -- decomposition. Decomposition happens in a couple of stages, each of which has a slightly different smell profile.



Decomposition after death involves about 800 different chemicals.
