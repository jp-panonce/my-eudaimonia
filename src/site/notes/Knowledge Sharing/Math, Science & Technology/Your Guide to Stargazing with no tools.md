### What do you want to see?


### When & Where do I Stargaze?

 The rule of thumb to stargazing is **"The darker, the better"**. 
 
 That means, you must do it at night of course. But that also means, you must do some steps to make your environment as dark as possible. How do I do this?
 
 - **No Other Light Sources**: same with gadgets, turn off or hide all things that have light sources. This includes:
	 - gadgets with screens
	 - flashlights or lamps
 - **Distance yourself from cities**: cities have light pollution, and all those lights will add up to less visibility. To know where you can go to in your local area, you may refer to [this website](https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/)
 - **Stargaze on a new moon**: The moon is also a light source, and a very bright one. Stargazing on a full moon will lead you to seeing fewer objects in the night sky. It's a different story though if you want to look at the moon. It's a beaut..

### Where do I look?
The answer to this questions depends on what you want to see. 

### Approximations by Hand

We can use our hands and fingers in making simple measurements. These can be used not only for measuring but also for finding objects in the sky

**First Step:** Stretch your hand to arm's length and close one eye.

The following hand/finger signs will give you an approximation of the **"degrees"** into which the celestial sphere is divided.
